AE Calculator (Almost Everything Calculator) 

GUI Calculator that includes common scientific/math formulas.
A selection box will appear to determine the formula to be used, then it will present the variables needed for the computation.
Once the variables are presented a user input of the values are to be done then it will present the answer.

Some formulas to be included are:
temperature conversion,
density,
bmi calculator,
molar mass of an element etc.

Common Physics, Chemistry, Statistics, Calculus formulas are also to be included in the selection box.
