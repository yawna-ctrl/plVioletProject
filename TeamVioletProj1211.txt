Today we have done the finalizing of the main codes, we have decided to 
make it the final coding so that we can already make the polishing of codes
if needed. Despite the unstable wifi connections of my other teammates, we 
have planned what we are going to do before the presentation for next week.
We already have planned last meeting what to we are to do for the next meeting 
so we were not very talkative in the google meet, but none the less there 
was work done today. We also went over the codes for today if there we
some codings we left out, and thankfully there were none. Today's activity, 
a part of it was opening other's progress and evaluating it, it was an 
interesting part in today's activity because we get to see a part of how other
groups are doing and how is their progress in the project. Thank you for today's
activity and time to work on the project sir, Team Violet wishes you a 
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
