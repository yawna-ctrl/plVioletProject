Today all we did were work on the formulas for the AE Calculator.
We already have done the IPO and we thought to divide the work done
today with Mr. Nepomuceno having to work on the GUI of the calculator, 
Ms. Navajas with I, Mr. Galang to work on coding the program. The plan 
was to divide the work and have the formulas be imported into the 
pyscript of where the GUI is. 

However there were some problems along the way, with the internet of 
Ms. Navajas being unstable and emergency concerning the wifi cable on 
my part aswell, there was a delay on the work progress having the suppose
to be divided work to finish early we were 1 man short but with the problem
the work was still able to be finished for the day. The solution that was 
made was the even though there was 1 man short the other team members 
plugged the hole and it is very respectable for the team mates to do so. 
The emergency concerning on my part was a DLTB bus went through out street
causing our cables to snap, we ran to get the attention of the bus driver 
and have it settled in the baranggay hall.
