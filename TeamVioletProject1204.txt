In today's Programming we continued on with working on the project
and did a lot of progress, we decided to take away the gui and just
import the formulas in with the main code. Today we added more of 
the formulas for the AE Calculator and worked on the main python code
as well as updating the github. 

After the dismissal we still continued on with working on the formulas
that is to be input, we each have split up the work for more ground to 
cover and we also planned to have another meeting tomorrow to work on it
again. THe only problems we have encountered was that Mr. Nepomuceno's 
wifi was unresponsive at the start and Ms. Navajas' unstable connections 
but other than that there was no other problems. For now we are done with 
coding the formulas and so far have an input of 23 formulas, tomorrow to 
be continued again.
